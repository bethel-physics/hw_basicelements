%% Problem 1
% Consider the equation
% f = (1/2pi)sqrt(k1k2/m(k1+k2))
% where k1 = 50, k2 = 100, and m = 2.
%
% * First, assign values for k1, k2, and m.
% * Next, assign the value to a new variable f, using the variables
% defined in the first step.

%% Problem 2
% The temperature distribution between to concentric
% tubes and in the radial direction is:
%
% T = Tb + [(Ta - Tb)ln(b/r)]/ln(b/a
%
% where r is the radius, and a <= r <= b. Given Ta = 0, Tb = 100,
% a = 1, and b = 2:
%
% * Determine the temperature for r = 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, …, 1.99,2.00.
% * Plot radial position (r) versus temperature (T) as a solid line.
% * On top of that plot, plot every 10th temperature value as a circle.
% * Label the axes and provide a title for the plot.

%% Problem 3
% Create two vectors, a row vector whose elements are 2n+1
% and a column vector whose elements are 3n+2, for n = 0,1,…,6. 

%% Problem 4
% Create a 5x5 square matrix whose elements are -1 along
% the diagonal and 1 everywhere else.  Please define the matrix using
% any of the following built-in functions: |zeros|, |ones|, and |diag|.

%% Problem 5
% Given the following system of equations
% 
% 1a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 30
%
% 2a + 1b + 3c + 4d = 29
%
% 3a + 1b + 2c + 4d = 27
%
% 4a + 1b + 2c + 3d = 24
%
% determine a, b, c, and d.

%% Problem 6
% The motion of a particular damped oscillator is
% described mathematically as the product of a decay function G1(t)
% and a sinusoidal function G2(t):
%
% F(t) = G1(t)G2(t) = exp(-t/2)sin(5t)
%
% Reproduce the graph below depicting the decay function
% G1(t) and the damped oscillatory motion F(t).
